My research focuses on understanding how epidemics spread in populations. I also try to provide practical, quantitative tools to control epidemics.

For the new comer, the first question may be: *How do we model epidemics?* [Here](/posts/knowledge/modelling-epidemics/) is a gentle, not too technical, introduction to infectious disease modelling. 

Once we have written the equations that represent the transmission process, we can start to analyze epidemics. 

For example, we can try to forecast them. Indeed, one of the most pressing question at the start of an outbreak is *"How bad is this likely to be?"*. 
Unlike weather forecasts that are usually fairly accurate, we have a very hard time forecasting epidemics once they have started. Even well-known pathogens, like seasonal influenza, is tricky to forecast.
