How do infectious diseases spread in populations? When will the epidemic peak? What are the best ways to control an outbreak?

For most of our history, we did not even ask those questions: plagues and other terrifying diseases swiped through villages and cities, killing or sickening people indiscriminately. We were simply defenceless against epidemics.

It is only recently, less than 200 years ago, that we understand that micro-organisms cause infectious diseases and can be transmitted between individuals, and sometimes even involve animals or insects.
We have also understood how pathogens cause disease and developed efficient tools against many of them: drugs to eliminate or weaken the pathogenic effects and vaccines to bluntly prevent infection. 

Unfortunately, even with drugs and vaccines, many infectious diseases manages to spread in populations. Some are well established ("endemic") like malaria or HIV, others appear sporadically, like Ebola or SARS.
Epidemiological studies investigate patterns of transmission for these epidemics in the affected populations. Are some groups of the populations at higher risks of infections? How is the pathogen transmitted?  
Answers to those questions help to guide public health responses aiming to reduce the number of infections. 

But even today, despite all our advances against infectious diseases, we often operate in a "fog of war" when facing an epidemic. Indeed, newly infected individuals cases are rarely systematically reported in a timely fashion. 
In other words, epidemics are usually poorly observed, making it very difficult to identify meaningful patterns of transmission in the population affected. And even when an epidemic is fairly well observed, public health professionals often want to identify the most efficient and cost-effective interventions. 
Finding those optimal interventions can be quite challenging given the uncertainty and complexity of the mechanisms driving an epidemic.

This is what my research tries to address. Using mathematics, statistics and computers, I model epidemics of infectious diseases to understand their transmission dynamics and provide quantitative tools to help to guide epidemic responses. 

We can translate the disease transmission process into equations, and feed them to mathematical theorems to get precise results about various epidemic outcomes. This allows us to understand the fundamental mechanisms at play during an epidemic. But unfortunately, a complete mathematical analysis is only feasible when we simplify drastically the description of epidemics.
