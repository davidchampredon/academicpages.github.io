The generation interval is simply the interval between the time when an individual is infected, and the time her/his infector was infected. 

For example, Alice was infected on day 3. Alice infects Bob on day 9. The generation interval for this transmission event is 9 - 3 = 6 days. 

As an epidemic outfolds, many transmission events occur. If we know all transmission times, we can calculate the generation interval associated with every transmission. The collection of all the generation intervals forms the generation interval distribution. This distribution is fundamental when modelling the disease transmission process. 

We usually cannot observe directly the actual infection times. However, the time of symptoms onset is often easier to observe. The interval between the symptoms onset of the newly infected individual and her/his infector is called the *serial* interval, and it is often used as a proxy for the generation interval.
