New strains of influenza can potentially cause severe pandemics, and public health responses are relatively limited. In particular, a vaccine targeting this new influenza strain would take at least 6 months to manufacture with the existing egg-based technologies, which is likely too long when compared to the 3 to 6 months length of a pandemic wave. 

In partnership with [Medicago](https://www.medicago.com/en/), a Canadian pharmaceutical company that invented a vaccine manufacturing process faster than the traditional egg-based methods, I developed a computational model to quantify how fast and how soon pandemic influenza vaccines should be administered in Ontario in order to have a noticeable impact on public health. 
This work highlighted the necessity to have not only an efficacious vaccine early, but also strong health systems that can sustain administrating vaccine doses at rates that may have to be multiples of what they usually deliver for vaccination against seasonal influenza.
