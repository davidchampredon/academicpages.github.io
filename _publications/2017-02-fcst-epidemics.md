Because epidemics are relatively rare and often poorly observed, it is difficult for scientists that develop forecasting models  to test and improve them against real data. 
To address that issue, forecasting "challenges" have been created. Synthetic epidemics are simulated by the organizers. Several academic groups are invited to forecast on a regular basis (e.g., weekly) the synthetic epidemics that are revealed at the same frequency. 
This exercise give scientists a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and improve their forecasting models. 

In 2016, we participated in the Ebola Challenge and this paper details the two different models we Jonathan Dushoff and I used to forecasts the synthetic Ebola epidemics. 

One model is a relatively standard compartmental model defined with ordinary differential equations. The other one has an  original approach and uses the renewal equation. 
Of note, this work was very influential for a more [recent study](/publication/2018-12-equiv-siam) I made regarding the equivalence between these two types of epidemic models.
