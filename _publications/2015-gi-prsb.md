The generation interval â€“ the interval between the time when an individual is infected by an infector and the time when this infector was infected - is a fundamental epidemiological quantity. 
In this work, we provide a simple and generic theoretical framework that links observed generation-interval distributions (typically from contact-tracing data) to the one used in epidemiological models. 
In particular, we provide a methodology to fit epidemiological models to observed contact tracing data that, unlike a naive but ubiquitous approach, correctly takes into account the nature of observed data.
