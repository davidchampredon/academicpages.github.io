"Compartmental models" is a type of mathemathetical models used to describe infectious diseases epidemic. They are by far the most popular models and the "Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered" (SIR) is [emblematic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology). 
In a nutshell, this type of model "tags" individuals according to their epidemiological state (e.g., susceptible, infectious, etc.) and describe with differential equations how individuals change their epidemiological states as the epidemic progresses.

A much _less_ popular way to model epidemics is to use the renewal (a.k.a [Euler-Lotka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lotka_equation)) equation. This type of model focuses only on how cohorts of infectious individuals transmit the disease. 

In the late 1970s, mathematicians proved that these two types of models are, in theory, equivalent. But, with the exception of the simplest cases, given one model, we did not have explicit and practical ways to make it equivalent to the other. 

In this study, we provide explicit formulations of the [generation-interval distribution](/posts/knowledge/generation-interval) that makes the renewal-equation model identical to broad and popular group of compartmental models.
