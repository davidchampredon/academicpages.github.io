Where HIV is prevalent in the general population (typically in some Sub-Sahara African countries), it is not clear what types of partnerships (casual, long-term, extra-couple) contribute the most to spreading the disease. Here, we constructed a dynamical model of transmission that simulated 10,000 hypothetical populations. 

We found that infection of uncoupled individuals is usually the predominant route, while transmission within discordant couples is usually important, but rarely represents the majority of transmissions. Moreover, we foundÂ that low discordance in a population may reflect a relatively high rate of within-couple transmission.
