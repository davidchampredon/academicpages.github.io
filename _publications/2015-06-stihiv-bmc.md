The infectiousness of an HIV-positive individual on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is very often reduced to levels where sexual transmission is unlikely. 
But what about if this individual is co-infected with another sexually transmitted infection (STI) like syphilis, chlamydia, etc.? 

This study reviews and synthesizes all published scientific evidence to assess the impact of sexually transmitted co-infection on HIV infectiousness among patients on anti-retroviral therapy. 
Using a hierarchical bayesian model, we found that, on average, ART maintains its effectiveness at controlling HIV viral load during STI co-infections. 
However, with data available until 2015, we could not rule out the possibility that certain STI co-infections have a larger effect.
