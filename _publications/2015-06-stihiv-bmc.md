The infectiousness of an HIV-positive individual is usually measured by her/his viral load: the number of HIV RNA copies in 1 milliliter of blood. The more copies, the more infectious is the patient. 
When a patient is on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the viral load, hence her/his infectiousness, is very often reduced to levels where sexual transmission is unlikely. 
But what about if this individual is co-infected with another sexually transmitted infection (STI) like syphilis, chlamydia, etc.? We know that for *untreated* patients, co-infection with another STI can increase their HIV viral load, that is their infectiousness.

This study reviews and synthesizes all published scientific evidence to assess the impact of sexually transmitted co-infection on HIV infectiousness among patients on anti-retroviral therapy. 
Using a hierarchical bayesian model, we found that, on average, ART maintains its effectiveness at controlling HIV viral load during STI co-infections. 
However, with data available until 2015, we could not rule out the possibility that certain STI co-infections have a larger effect.
